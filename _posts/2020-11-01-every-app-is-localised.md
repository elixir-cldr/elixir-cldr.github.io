title: Every Application is Localised

### Every application is localised

Start-ups and established businesses alike aim to engage with their customers, create a trusted relationship and in manu cases aim to be a destination for a target audience. Common doctrine says that deeper engagement with customers has a direct impact on revenue and profit.

[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/24/50-stats-that-prove-the-value-of-customer-experience/?sh=274559da4ef2) suggests businesses with a customer experience mind-set outperform other businesses by 80%.

> Companies that lead in customer experience outperform laggards by nearly 80%. 84% of companies that work to improve their customer experience report an increase in their revenue.

Given that presenting and accepting input from users in formats that that reflect their individual preferences (often based upon cultural factors) is an important part of customer experience, why aren't all developers considering localization as part of their applciation strategy?  Larger application vendors certainly do.

In my experience the conversation often goes "I need to ship, I'll localise later". However I would say that every application is, by definition, localised. Since all information is being presented in a defined language, script and format. Usually one reflective of the developers home culture or the "Internet default" of US English which is close to being a common denominator for developers around the world.

Another argument goes that the US is the largest online economy and the most open market and therefore developing for US consumers first makes the most economic sense. However if we compare the revenue for online retailers for Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the US to Singles Day in China we find that Singles Day is [more than double the size of Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/singles-day-officially-bigger-than-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-combined).

In Indonesia, a country of 294m people (ie similar in size to the USA), [90% of people between the ages of 16 to 64 purchased goods online in the 12 months to September 2019](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-ecommerce-in-indonesia).

> GlobalWebIndex reports that Indonesia has the highest rate of ecommerce use of any country in the world, with 90 percent of the countryâ€™s internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 reporting that they already buy products and services online.

It's a faster growing economy [avering over 5% annual growth from 2000 to 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/indonesia/gdp-growth-annual) and it has an investmenrt-oriented market economy. For the same period of time, the US economy has been growing at [an aveage of 2%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth-annual).

These are simple examples intended only to illustrate that by not thinking about global audiences, application developers are potentially alienating potential customres simply because they aren't respecting the customers preferences when it comes to presentation and input.

### Barriers to localisation

In conversation with developers, the biggest barrier has been the assumption that localing is complex, difficult and time-consuming. Getting to market fast has a higher priority.
